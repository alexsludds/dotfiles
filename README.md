# dotfiles
This is a place for me to store the dotfiles that I use for linux

# python
Currenty there is a python script which is associated with this repo. The idea is that the user can list to locations of their dotfiles inside of the dotfiles class by appending their locations to a list. Then, when the script is run it will copy these dotfiles into the dotfiles folder. Then it will upload the repo to github for storage.
